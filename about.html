          <p>
            A hard-working, highly motivated and determined natural team
            player/leader who is able to develop and drive the business forward.
            I am an easy-going person and always maintain excellent working
            relationships with colleagues and clients. My ambitions and passion
            for success allowed me to thrive in a competitive retail
            environment, but I have now decided to make a turn in my career and
            try myself in Web development. I have a work visa as a dependant (so
            nothing for my new employer to worry about) that will allow me to
            settle permanently in the UK.
